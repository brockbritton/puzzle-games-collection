# Puzzle Games Players and Solvers

Overview:
I love puzzle games. While they are often straightforward tasks, the layers of the problem can make it difficult to complete.
Problem solving is an intrinsic aspect of life. Since these games straightforward I find them fun cathartic to solve and I hope you can derive some enjoyment too. 
So far I have built ways to play or solve versions of bingo and sudoku. Upcoming/Working on are hangman, word searches, battleship and more.
